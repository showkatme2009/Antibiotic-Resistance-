# Antibiotic-Resistance-
Detecting Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria from Microscopic Images using Deep Learning
we introduce a new deep-learning pipeline that integrates U-Netâ€“based semantic segmentation. 
With morphological post-processing to rapidly identify antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli from fluorescence microscopy images. 
Our system extracts morphological features of the cell membrane (Nile Red) stained images and a subsequent Random Forest classifier. [11] Predicts the resistant or susceptible status of bacterial cells.
